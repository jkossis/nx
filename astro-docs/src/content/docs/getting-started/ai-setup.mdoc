Nx provides deep integration with AI coding assistants through the **Nx Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**, giving your AI assistant comprehensive understanding of your monorepo structure, running processes, and development workflows.

## Quick Setup

Run the following command to automatically configure your Nx workspace for AI assistants:

```shell
npx nx configure-ai-agents
```

This command will:

- Prompt you to select which AI agents/assistants to configure
- Set up the [Nx MCP server](/docs/features/enhance-ai) for your chosen tools
- Create AI agent configuration files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.)

For manual setup instructions and client-specific configuration, see [Enhance Your LLM](/docs/features/enhance-ai#setting-up-nx-mcp).

## What You Get

Once configured, your AI assistant can:

- **Understand your workspace** - Project relationships, dependencies, and architecture
- **Access CI context** - Build failures, test results, and deployment status
- **Generate code intelligently** - Use Nx generators with contextual defaults
- **Analyze impact** - Understand how changes affect your entire monorepo

Explore the full capabilities in [Enhance Your LLM](/docs/features/enhance-ai).

## AI-Powered CI

Nx can automatically detect CI failures, analyze errors, and propose fixes directly to your PR.
